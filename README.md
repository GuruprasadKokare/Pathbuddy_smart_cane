# PathBuddy: An IoT-based Smart Cane for Visually Impaired Individuals

## Description:
Developed an innovative IoT-based smart cane designed to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. The project addressed the limitations of traditional canes and existing available solutions by incorporating advanced features such as vertical and horizontal obstacle detection, muddy area detection, emergency alert and traffic signal recognition and alerting.

## Key Features:

### Obstacle Detection: 
Utilized HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors for detecting obstacles at various heights, ensuring comprehensive environmental awareness.

### Surface Condition Detection: 
Employed a soil moisture sensor to detect wet or muddy surfaces, preventing slips and falls.

### Emergency Alert System: 
Included a push button feature to send SOS messages to pre-selected contacts, enhancing user safety during emergencies.

### Traffic Signal Recognition: 
Integrated with mobile application and machine learning algorithms to detect traffic signals and provide auditory cues for safe navigation across streets.

## Technologies Used:

### Hardware: 
ESP32 microcontroller, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, soil moisture sensor, camera, buzzer, push buttons, rechargeable batteries.
### Software: 
Arduino IDE, YOLO V8, Google collab, Flutter, VScode.
## Impact:
PathBuddy significantly improves the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals by offering enhanced navigational aid, obstacle detection, and emergency support. The project received positive feedback for its innovative approach and practical application in real-world scenarios.
